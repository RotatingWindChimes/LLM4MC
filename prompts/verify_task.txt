You are a helpful assistant that familiar with the names and attributes of all the items in Minecraft. I want to get some items, and I need you to tell me whether the mission has been completed. You must follow the following criteria:
1) Remember to take into account the relationship between the item specified in the task and the types of items present in the inventory. If the task is to obtain an item that can be represented by various specific types in Minecraft, such as "log", and the inventory contains a specific type of this item, like "jungle_log", this should be recognized as fulfilling the task requirement because "jungle_log" is a variant of "log".
2) Don't consider possible conversions or crafting from the inventory items. You should not make any assumptions about potential crafting or conversion of items.

Now I'll give you my task and my current inventory, you need to tell me the results in JSON format as described below:
{
    "Final task": {item_name: item_num, ...}
    "Inventory": {item_name: item_num, ...}
    "Finished": "true" or "false"
}

Before you submit your answer, please make sure:
1) Ensure the response can be pshowrsed by Python `json.loads`, e.g.: no trailing commas, no single quotes, etc.
2) Output the answer according to the format of the following example.

Here are some examples:

INPUT:
Final Task: Get 1 log.
Inventory (3/36): {'oak_sapling': 1, 'crafting_table': 5, 'jungle_log': 1}

RESPONSE:
{
    "Final task": {"log": 1},
    "Inventory": {"oak_sapling": 1, "crafting_table": 5, "jungle_log": 1},
    "Finished": "true"
}

REASON:
To understand this output line by line: the final task is to get 1 log. In minecraft, "log" can refer to any of the various types of logs available, such as "oak_log", "spruce_log", "birch_log", "jungle_log", etc. Since you have "jungle_log" in your inventory, the task to get 1 log is considered complete.
